Hey everyone, my name is Fowzan and I am computer science undergrad.
I am interested in problem solving, maths, programming and everything related to critical thinking.
Currently learning algorithms and data structures to grasp in depth understanding of programming
I’m looking to collaborate on solving complex coding problems and build real world projects that solve serious problems.
